- ttytter (http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/)
- Perl 5.10
- Perl modules: DBD::SQLite, Text::CSV_XS, HTML::Entities, Regexp::Common, DateTime, Hailo

How to use this:

- Dowload your twitter archive from https://twitter.com/settings/account
- You'll receive a file called "tweets.zip", we need the "tweets.csv" file from it.
- Run "build_brain.pl", it will read the tweets.csv file from the current directory or from a location in the argument.
  This will generate the initial brain database "tweets.brn".
- Run the file "test.pl" to generate random lines from the previously learned input.
- Setup ttytter with your bot's account. The bot account must follow your account so it can keep learning from new tweets.
- Start "run_bot.sh" to run ttytter with the supplied plugin.
